/**
 * Effort memory: per-model reasoning-effort levels, re-applied automatically
 * when a model switch lands without one.
 *
 * The official model list submits a model switch as a selection WITHOUT an
 * effort unless the model advertises a default (`ModelSelect` builds its
 * choices from `reasoning.defaultEffort`, which hand-declared models never
 * carry) — and the host replaces the session's whole selection, so the
 * previous level is dropped and the trigger reads "Default". Wrapping the
 * shared per-session directory's `select` (the SAME instance the official
 * seat, the /model popup, and this plugin's slider all submit through) lets
 * the remembered level ride the switch in ONE atomic commit: no "Default"
 * flash, and every surface shows the re-applied level.
 *
 * The memory is keyed by "provider/model-id" — the exact fields a selection
 * carries — because the same model id under two providers names two models,
 * and display names are editable and never unique. Two delivery paths share
 * one fallback chain (the SESSION'S own sighting of a level the user picked
 * in it, else the per-model configured pick from the settings document, else
 * the last cross-session memory from localStorage, else the last
 * PROVIDER-NATIVE sighting from a replay when it names an advertised
 * level, else the VENDOR'S documented default from the knowledge base, else
 * the official no-effort behaviour):
 *   - the wrapped `select`: a model switch submitted without a level rides
 *     the remembered level in ONE atomic commit — no "Default" flash, and
 *     every surface shows the re-applied level;
 *   - the projection watcher: a RESTORED session's durable selection arrives
 *     from session history without going through `select` at all, so the
 *     watcher re-applies the chain to a level-less projection (one successful
 *     attempt per model per directory lifetime; a REFUSED attempt is refunded
 *     and retried on the next store update, up to a small ceiling — which
 *     also keeps an explicit provider-default pick from being fought).
 * Discipline both paths keep:
 *   - an EXPLICIT level (slider drag, any effort row) always wins: it is
 *     remembered for that exact model and submitted untouched — and it is
 *     recorded as a SESSION sighting, which outranks the configured pick for
 *     the rest of the session (switching away and back must not lose it);
 *   - an effort-less selection for the CURRENT model is an explicit "follow
 *     the provider default" and must pass through untouched — the session
 *     sighting dies with it;
 *   - nothing is injected while the slider preference (the seat the memory
 *     serves) is switched off.
