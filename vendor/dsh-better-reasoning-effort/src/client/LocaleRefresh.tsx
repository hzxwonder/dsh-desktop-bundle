/**
 * Re-translates a mounted subtree when the shell's active language changes.
 *
 * `ctx.locale.bind()` hands out ONE stable translate function per namespace
 * (memo-safety by design, so the reference can ride inject surfaces), which
 * leaves a mounted subtree with no signal that the copy it rendered is stale:
 * the function is the same object, and nothing re-renders to call it again.
 * The shell's own outlets do not have this problem — the slot renderer
 * re-derives their `t` from (namespace, revision), so a language switch hands
 * them a NEW function. Our editors mount through `createRoot` and sit outside
 * that machinery entirely, so they need the revision subscription spelled out.
 *
 * `children` is a thunk on purpose: returning a cached element would let React
 * bail out of the subtree (an unchanged element reference short-circuits the
 * re-render), so it has to be rebuilt on every render.
 *
