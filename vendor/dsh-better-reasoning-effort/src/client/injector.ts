/**
 * The DOM bypass injector: the piece that makes reasoning effort editable
 * *inside* the official Models page's model rows.
 *
 * The official Models-page slot contract's two sanctioned seats are both
 * coarser than a model row: the keyed `settings.models.provider-card`
 * renders per provider card and `settings.models.footer`
 * renders after the rows — neither reaches a single model row's editor
 * internals, so this plugin mounts its editor as a DOM contribution next to
 * the official per-model capacity disclosure. The anchor is the official
 * "Capacities" (容量) chevron
 * button, found by aria-label in both locales; the editor is inserted into the
 * same disclosure container that holds the official context-window / max
 * tokens fields.
 *
 * Because this walks the official page's rendered DOM (class names and
 * structure that the harness can change), the injector is defensive by
 * construction:
 *   - it re-scans on every DOM mutation (a routed page, an open editor, an
 *     applied form all re-render), and every scan reconciles idempotently;
 *   - a model row that carries no disclosure yet is left alone and picked up
 *     on the next mutation;
 *   - if the official structure it depends on ever stops appearing, it simply
 *     stops injecting — the settings page remains untouched.
