 * Model-level provenance marker written beside every ladder the HOST autofill
 * fills from the knowledge base, carrying the settings revision the fill read.

 * It exists because the host fills in-process the moment a provider is
 * committed, while the browser's staged-declaration flush waits out its scan
 * debounce: by the time the flush compares the document against its own
 * suggestion, the suggestion is already there. Byte equality alone cannot then
 * tell "the plugin wrote this" from "the user declared this" -- a staged ladder
 * that differs from the knowledge base in even one spelling (the editor's
 * `off: null` against the knowledge base's `off: 'none'`) was dropped as a
 * document takeover, i.e. the reported "configured it on the add-provider card,
 * saved, and it is gone".
 *
 * With the marker the flush knows the stored ladder is a suggestion, so a
 * staged user intent overrides it. Either way the user's bytes win; the marker
 * only decides whether the flush is allowed to write at all. Schemastery passes
 * unknown model keys through, so the marker survives official-page saves and
 * restarts like the other two markers. Any ladder written through the plugin
 * clears it, which is what makes a later hand edit outrank a fresh staging.
